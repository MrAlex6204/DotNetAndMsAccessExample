<b>Ms Access Data Base Connection to C# in Visual Studio 2008 </b>

I created this project along time ago for a friend from Yahoo Answer , who ask me 
how to create a Data Base connection to access and I decided to develop this little system,
not for only teach him how to create a code for the connection, even to explain him how to apply
Object Oriented Programming.

This is a Little SuperMarket System with a Access Data Base but the Data Base not only show you
how to Insert/Update/Select Data from it. Even explain how to create a useful View in data base
and how to call them from the application.

The code comments are in Spanish.



Is be along time when I develop this little system just for fun.
My code and skills since then my code and skills has been more improved.

Share this code or send to me an email if you want me to translate to english or an explanation of it.
